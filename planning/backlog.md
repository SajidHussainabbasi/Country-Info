##  Backlog â€“ *Country-Info*

###  Must-Have
- [x] Fetch country data from REST Countries API (`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}`)
- [x] Display country details (name, flag, capital, region, population, languages, currencies)
- [x] Basic user input to search by country name
- [x] Show error message if country is not found or request fails
- [x] Use async/await for API calls
- [x] Separation of concerns (modules: `handlers`, `listeners`, `components`, `api-calls`)
- [x] Trigger search by both button click and pressing "Enter"
- [x] Modular folder structure with clean file organization
- [x] Display country flag with alt text
- [x] Basic responsive UI with CSS

- [ ] Show multiple results if more than one country matches
- [ ] Include bordering countries with clickable navigation
- [ ] Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Auto-focus input field on page load
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility improvements
- [ ] Save recent search history (localStorage)
