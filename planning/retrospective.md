## Retrospective – Country-Info

###  What Went Well
- Integration with the REST Countries API was straightforward and reliable
- Clean separation of concerns (API, handlers, listeners, components) improved maintainability and readability
- Search functionality worked well with both button click and Enter key
- Displaying country data such as flag, capital, population, and languages provided a complete snapshot
- Basic CSS made the UI responsive and easy to navigate

###  What Can Improve
- UI could be more visually engaging with icons, colors, or animations
- No loading indicator, so users don't get feedback during data fetching
- Limited feedback for invalid or empty input — could use more helpful error messages
- Bordering countries and related features are missing, which could enhance exploration
- Accessibility could be improved with better ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
